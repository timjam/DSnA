# Set

Set is a data structure that contains only unique items of a certain type.

Usually set supports at least following methods:

1. Contains: Returns true if set contains given item, otherwise false
2. Insert: Adds new element to the set. Returns nothing or error if element is already present in the set
3. Remove: Removes an item from set. Does nothing if the item is not present in the set
4. Union: Returns a new set containing all unique items from two sets
5. Intersect: Returns a new set containing only unique items that exists in both two sets
6. Subtract: Returns a new set containing all items present in one set, but not in another
7. Get_size: Returns the number of items in set
8. Is_empty: Returns true, if there are no items present in the set. False otherwise.
