# Queue

Queue is a linear one dimensional data structure where its elements are processed in FIFO order. At simples form queue is a linked list where its elements can be inserted with _enqueue_ method and taken out with _dequeue_ method.

Usually queue supports at least following methods:

1. Enqueue: Inserts a new element at the back of the queue
2. Dequeue: Takes out for processing the first element in the queue

## TypeScript

Idea is to implement the Queue as a class where the values are stored in a list, but inserted and returned as described with _enqueue_ and _dequeue_ methods.
