# Vector data structure

Vector as definition is basically just a one dimensional list or array. Usually in staticaly typed languages like C++ vector has been like a dynamic array, which grows dynamically in size and has a built in memory allocation, whereas arrays are fixed size. Vector can also be a mathematical data structure with characteristics like magnitude and direction.

## TypeScript

Because arrays in javascript and also in typescript behave already like vectors, I am not going to try to implement a generic vector data structure, but just mathematical vector Vector3D that represents a 3-dimensional vector. If you think there could be a specific vector data structure implemented in JS/TS, hit me up and create a new issue on this repo. Also point me good material and read, so I can educate myself and implement that generic vector as well.
